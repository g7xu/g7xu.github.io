      As I am about to graduate from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Data Science,
      my experience spans academic research, industrial software development,
      and teaching. I have co-authored a published research paper on data science
      education at ACM SIGCSE. I designed automated pipelines and an eight-table
      database for millions of weekly patent and trademark records. I have applied
      data analysis to large-scale microbiome and airline datasets. I have taught
      over 500 students in the Data Science courses of my department, receiving
      perfect evaluations from all participants.

      Currently, I am enhancing the data pipeline I developed, expanding its
      capabilities to integrate complex, pre-existing datasets like copyright
      and patent images from legal cases. To bridge my technical skills with
      market expertise, I am immersing myself in finance-related coursework,
      preparing for a career at the intersection of data engineering and
      financial technology.
    </p>

      Starting in July, I am excited to join Cadre.AI, a San Diego-based AI
      consulting startup, as an AI Engineer Intern, where I will contribute to AI
      integrations and strategy development. This experience, combined with my
      pursuit of a Finance minor, is the next deliberate step toward my ultimate
      goal of becoming a Quantitative Developer, where I can leverage my passion
      for complex data systems to solve challenges in the financial markets.
