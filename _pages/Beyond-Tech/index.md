For me, life is like a project—an estimated 77.5-year-long project, which translates to 28,287 days. In addition to
social status and money that everyone is working hard for. I also hope that my life has a sense of richness and 
texture—this comes from my attitude toward and love for life. This page is where I share aspects of my personal life.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <strong>《不第后赋菊》</strong><br>
    <em>Author: 黄巢</em><br><br>
    待到秋来九月八，我花开后百花杀。
    冲天香阵透长安，满城尽带黄金甲。
