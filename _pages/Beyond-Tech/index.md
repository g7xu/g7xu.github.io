**Under Construction**

> True strength is not about resistance but about acceptance.  
> It is about allowing regrets, foolishness, ugliness, hypocrisy, and unreciprocated efforts to exist.  
> When you embrace all of this, you gradually become a soft, relaxed, and open individual—which is to say, an incredibly strong person.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <strong>《不第后赋菊》</strong><br>
    <em>作者：黄巢</em><br><br>
    待到秋来九月八，<br>
    我花开后百花杀。<br>
    冲天香阵透长安，<br>
    满城尽带黄金甲。
