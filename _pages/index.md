# About me üëã
---
Hi, I am Guoxuan(ÂæêÂõΩËΩ©), or you can call me Jason. I am currently a third-year undergraduate student studying Data Science 
at University of California San Diego (UCSD). While I am exploring specific domain to focus on for long term, my interest
lie in bioinformatic and machine learning. These fields offer a rich combination challenges, transferable skills, and
impactful applications that resonate deeply with me.

Reflecting on my past career, I've worked as tutor for two different data science courses, tutoring 500+ first year students
using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis. I was also privileged to be among the first
cohort of students working in [DSTL Lab](https://dstl.ucsd.edu/), supervised by [Sam Lau](https://lau.ucsd.edu/). In the lab,
I spent part of time contributing to the Pandas Tutor codebase, enhancing its capability to handle large datasets. Additionally,
I conduct a research study to explore effective strategies used by professional data scientists to understand complex data science
notebooks. Most recently, I just finished my first industrial internship at Tong Consulting Inc. Under the mentorship of Tom Dai,
I analyzed an encrpted flight dataset for a client. I propose five most profitable round-trip routes in the U.S. domestric market.

I am currently tutoring DSC 40A under Kyle. I also worked as a research intern at Scripps Research as a part of [the Wu Lab](https://wulab.io/).
In the lab, I'm working on integrating data resouces into the API system for [mygene.info](https://mygene.info/). Additionaly,
I am gaining industry experience as a data science intern at [LLM-strategy](https://www.llmstrategies.com/), under the mentorship of [Serge De Coster](https://www.llmstrategies.com/team/).
