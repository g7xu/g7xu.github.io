<!-- 
In this paper, we design and conduct a user speak-aloud study to inveestigate effective learning practices for
understanding data science workbooks. Using a past data science as the study material, participants were asked to
explain their understanding of the code. Based on their responses, we proposed three key methodologies in
understanding data science workbook: **understanding the data schema** (including basic statistics, missingness, 
and attributes), **employing a guess-and-check approach**, and **adopting goal-oriented exploration**. -->
